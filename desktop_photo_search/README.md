# Photo Search app

This desktop application enables you to search 
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for photographs that interest you. 
To use it, you need to add an **Access Key** from 
[Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to
`lib/unsplash_access_key.dart`.

This is the Photo Search app, built out with two different widget sets:

  - [Material](material) shows the Photo Search app built with [Material widgets][]
  - [Fluent UI](fluent_ui) shows the Photo Search app built with [Fluent UI][] widgets

[Fluent UI]: https://pub.dev/packages/fluent_ui
[Material widgets]: https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material
