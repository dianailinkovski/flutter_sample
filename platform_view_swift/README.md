# platform_view_swift

A Flutter sample app that combines a native iOS UIViewController
with a full-screen Flutter view.

## Goals for this sample

* Show a simple technique for combining native and Flutter views.

## The important bits

### `lib/main.dart`

The Flutter part of the application is quite simple, and all the action
takes place in a single file.

### `ios/Runner/PlatformViewController.swift` and `AppDelegate.swift`

These files contain the Swift code responsible for setting up a platform
channel, launching a native UIViewController, and returning control to
Flutter when finished.
